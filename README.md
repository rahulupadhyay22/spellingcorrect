# SpellChecker App

A simple Python command-line application that checks and corrects the spelling of words in user-provided text. This app uses the `SpellChecker` library to identify and correct misspelled words.

## Features

- **Automatic Spell Checking**: Checks each word in the input text for spelling errors.
- **Real-Time Suggestions**: Provides corrected words for any identified misspellings.
- **Interactive**: Allows continuous spell checking until the user decides to exit.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/spellchecker-app.git
   cd spellchecker-app
   ```

2. **Install Required Package**
   Make sure you have the `pyspellchecker` package installed. You can install it via pip:
   ```bash
   pip install pyspellchecker
   ```

### Usage

Run the app with the following command:
```bash
python spell_checker.py
```

Once started, enter any text to check spelling. Type `exit` when you want to quit the app.

### Example

```plaintext
Welcome to the Spelling Corrector App!
Enter text to check spelling (or type "exit" to quit): Helo world
"Helo" has been corrected to "Hello"
Corrected text: Hello world

Enter text to check spelling (or type "exit" to quit): exit
Closing the app, goodbye!
```

## Code Overview

- **Importing SpellChecker**: Imports the `SpellChecker` class from the `spellchecker` library.
- **App Class**: The `SpellCheckerApp` class contains methods for spell checking (`correct_text`) and running the app (`run`).
- **Main Execution**: When the script is run as the main program, it creates an instance of `SpellCheckerApp` and starts the app.
